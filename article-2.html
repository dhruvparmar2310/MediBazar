            <h5>Abstract:</h5>Assessment of body fat is an important measure of the nutritional status as it is directly related to obesity and other health related diseases. Skinfolds are often used method for (%) body fat measurements. Many times it is found to be difficult compared to Girth  measurement technique. So, this study was conducted  to find  correlation between both the techniques and also using different  equations for skinfold  calipers. 30 Participants were evaluated for Body fat % with skinfold caliper and inelastic tape measure. All the measurements were taken on the right side of body with the subject standing upright. Average of two measurements was taken for analysis. Significant Positive correlation was found for Girth measurement and skinfold technique. Being a quick and easy administered method, Girth measurement technique can be used for assessment of body fat like skinfolds.<br/><br/>

            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3><hr/><br/>
            Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have adverse effect on health. Assessment of body fat is an important measure of the nutritional status as it is directly related to obesity and other health related diseases. Most body composition analysis is based on seeing the body as consisting two separate compartments, fat and fat-free mass. Thus, body composition is often defined as the ratio fat to fat-free mass. Out of many methods, the most common methods to  assess body fat are anthropometric test, especially skinfolds thickness  measure, which provides an estimate of the subcutaneous fat deposition, recalculated for the total body fat or body density. Determination of body composition from skinfolds measurement is based on the fact that a large proportion of total body fat is stored directly underneath the skin. Girth measurements offer an easily administered, valid and attractive alternative to skinfolds. Along with predicting percentage body fat, girth measurements can also be used to analyze patterns of body fat distribution. 
          </p><br/>

            <h3>NEED OF STUDY</h3><hr/><br/>
            Many times it is difficult to use skinfold caliper compared to Girth measurement technique.  So, this study was conducted to find correlation between both the techniques and also using different equations for skinfold caliper. 
          </p><br/>
          <p>
            <h3>AIM</h3><hr/><br/>
            To measure and correlate body fat using both Skinfold caliper method and Girth measurement method.
          </p><br/>
          <p>
            <h3>MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY</h3><hr/><br/>
            This Correlation study was conducted on 30 <strong>(Male =15, Female=15)</strong> young individuals according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals were recruited from Physiotherapy College and OPD. Inclusion criteria were kept as age of <strong>18-25 years</strong> and who were willing to participate. The criteria for exclusion were any pathological conditions affecting the whole body (Orthopaedic, Cardio respiratory, Neurological and/or surgical conditions). After taking the informed consent participants  were explained the procedure. Skinfold Caliper (Saehen), paper, Pen, Inelastic Measure Tape was used for the assessment. 
          </p><br/>
          <p>
            <h3>PROCEDURE</h3><hr/><br/>
            After explaining the procedure, Skinfold measurement and Girth measurement were taken in all subjects using Sahen Skin fold Caliper and  measure Tape respectively.  Participants were randomly  undergone for  both the  measurement technique.  Skin fold measurements taken were chest, midaxillary, triceps, subscapular, abdomen, suprailiac and thigh. All the folds were measured on right side of body with the subject standing upright. Measurement was taken twice for each site and average measurement was considered and Siri’s equation was used for calculation of Body fat <strong>%[ %Fat= 495/Body density- 450 ].</strong> For Girth measurement inelastic tape measure was used. The tape was placed on the skin surface without compressing the subcutaneous adipose tissue. <strong>Figure 1 & 2</strong> shows the technique of measurement. Formulas used in the present study were:

            Three different formulas are there to calculate body density, different for men and women.

            <h3>DISCUSSION</h3><hr/><br/>
            <p>
              This study was conducted to find out correlation between skinfold measurement and girth measurement methods for the assessment of body fat. % body fat was calculated for 30 participants using different equations of skinfold method (3 equations) and for girth measurement method for male and female. Results showed significant positive correlation for skinfold measurement and girth measurement technique. Girth measurement techniques are easy to administer compared to skinfold measurement techniques. It requires  proper  practice  and  knowledge  of  measuring  skinfold  to  get  accurate  measurements.  For  field  assessments,  girth measurement techniques are very helpful to measure body fat. Girth measurements make the work fast & easy and can be just taking by a simple measure tape anytime and  anywhere. So we can also use girth measurements, as  both the methods showed significant Positive correlation for fat measurement. Limitation of the study was that only one age group of participants (Young) was taken.
            </p><br/>
            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3><hr/><br/>
            <p>
              Being a quick and easy administered method, Girth measurement technique can be used for assessment of body fat like Skinfolds.
            </p><br/>
            <h3>FUTURE STUDY</h3><hr/><br/>
            <p>
              Study can be done with more objective method of body fat measurement and compared with girth measurement. Also the study can be done with many age groups.
